WildSex 2.0
=======

A Bukkit plugin that randomly puts wild animals in love mode, creating natural population increase.

Configuration
-------------
The config.yml file supports the following settings:

* mateMode (false by default) pairs animals with a close pair and then sets both on love mode, guaranteeing reproduction in the case where there is an eligible pair close by.
* interval (10 by default) the number between two WildSex runs, in minutes.
* chance (0.1 by default) the possibility of a random animal being set on love mode. 0 disables the plugin and 1 sets every animal on love mode on every run.
* auto-update (true by default) updates the plugin automatically whenever a new version is released. All versions will maintain backwards compatibility, so keeping this on is a good idea.

Supported Versions
-------------------
All CraftBukkit & Spigot releases for:
* 1.7.9
* 1.7.10

Known Bugs
----------
* The XP removal system does not function as expected - XP still drops from breeding animals.
